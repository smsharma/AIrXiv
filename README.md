AIrXiv is a prototype for an LLM-powered ArXiv research assistant. It is an Electron app with a Flask backend powered by the OpenAI API. AIrXiv relies on a user-facing [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Implementation Notes

- AIrXiv attempts to extract the TeX source of the papers when they are added to the database. If this fails, PDF extraction is used.
- AIrXiv uses a simple top-k similarity search (`k = 3` by default) from a FAISS vector store. `k` can be set in `config.yml`, along with the chunk size and stride length of chunks (512 and 384 by default).
- Frontend elements are in `static`, and backend elements are in `util` and `main.py`.

## Installation

Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/smsharma/AIrXiv/issues) if you are having problems with installation. 

0. (Prerequisites) Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS version recommended) and Python >=3.7.
1. Clone and `cd` into the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/smsharma/AIrXiv.git
cd AIrXiv
```
2. Install the required Python packages using the provided environment.yml file. You can use Conda or any other environment manager of your choice:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate airxiv
```
3. Install the required Node.js packages by running the following command:
```
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the Electron app with 
```
npm run dev
```
which launches the Python/Flask backend (`python main.py` or `npm run start-flask`) as well as the frontend (`npm start`). If this fails, try running the two commands separately. Add an arXiv ID or two, enter your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in the text box towards the bottom, and start asking questions!

Usage notes:
- Either `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4` can be selected in the app settings. `gpt-4` is significantly better in particular at implementing code, but is about an order of magnitude more expensive (~$0.02/1000 tokens) compared `gpt-3.5-turbo`, and additionally API access is subject to a [waitlist](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api).
- Paper querying can be turned off by checking "Don't query papers" in the settings. This then simply relies on the general capabilities of the model.
- **All output should be verified for integrity.**
